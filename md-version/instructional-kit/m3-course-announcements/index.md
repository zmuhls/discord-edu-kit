## Model Uses

See below for some of the model ways in which you can put an #announcements channel to use in your classroom server.

1. **Course Expectations**: for communicating your expectations to students regarding upcoming assignments and homework parameters as well as anticipated in-class activities.
2. **Homework Reminders**: for reiterating homework deadlines and parameters drawn from your week-by-week schedule for the course. At the end of every class, you can post homework reminders in the #announcements channel to keep momentum going into subsequent classes.
3. **Syllabus Updates**: for discussing any revisions or updates that you might make to your syllabus throughout the semester.
4. **Sharing Links**: for making key links and web content available to students in a centralized space among your server. These might include submission portals, assignment descriptions, and related course content.
5. **Uploading Files**: for uploading files for in-class activities, assignments, and related course materials in a centralized space among your server.
6. **Polling Students**: for taking the temperature on student sentiments in relation to ongoing course activities. In order to poll students, you can use emoji reactions and react to your own post one time for each emoji signifying the options of the poll.

## Feature Suggestions

Below you will find a series of ways to leverage the features available to you in Discord when making announcements to your class.

1. **Role Permissions**: Set the role permissions of #announcements so that students can add reactions to your messages. You can use these emoji reactions to infer the relative reach of your messages, which helps in taking the temperature of your class down the line.
2. **Role Management**: Adding the default @everyone role to your message will send students a push notification, which increases visibility of your message and may also indicate to them that you've sent a class-wide announcement.
3. **Notification Settings**: Students active on Discord may customize their personal notification settings for your classroom server. In particular, they reserve the ability to suppress notifications from certain channels and roles including @mentions, @everyone, and @here. In openly discussing the matter with them, you can suggest that they override their default notification settings for the #announcements channel at minimum. They can do so by adding #announcements to their notification overrides as depicted below.
