Tired of reinventing the wheel? Adopt a server template based on another instructor’s classroom server. 

Enclosed below you will find a small but growing collection of open-access templates for you to reuse and revise with instruction in mind. Crowdsourced from faculty across the City University of New York (CUNY), these use cases demonstrate how instructors tailor Discord to their teaching and learning needs. They cross a range of disciplines — from English, to Theatre and Speech, to Media and Technology — while accommodating multiple learning styles and teaching practices in the process. 

## **Template Adoption**

You can preview and create servers based on these models by following the steps below:

1. Click the server’s name for a link to preview its channels, roles, and use number 
2. Name the server
3. Click **Create Server** 
4. Head to Discord to review the server in action

Templates carry over the settings, channels, categories, roles, and permissions of their original server models; however, they do not include any of the original server’s integrations, images, messages, or member details when formatted for reuse.
