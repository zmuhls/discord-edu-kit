## Welcome Back!

This section of the toolkit is the second of three module sequences in support of teaching and learning with Discord. Design Kit modules will help you plan the structure of your classroom server so you can flexibly tailor it to the learning needs of your students. 

We begin by addressing some of the course models on which you might base your classroom server. We then cover channel models that you can use to populate your classroom server once you have it up and running. The third module discusses how to utilize Discord bots in your server to facilitate the learning process and streamline server features. The fourth and final module offers a collection of server templates for you to adopt going forward. 

Let’s get started, shall we?
