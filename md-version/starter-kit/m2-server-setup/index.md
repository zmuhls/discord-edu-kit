After you open the app and sign in, Discord will prompt you to set up your first server. Here’s how: 

1. Click **Create My Own**
2. Click **For me and my friends**
    - This option means you intend to create a private server, and mean to give access only to invited users. The other option is to create a “Community Server,” which openly lists your server to the public for those interested to join on their own accord
3. Give your server a name, then upload an image as its icon
    - Name: I recommend your course title and subtitle so that students can easily access it
    - Image: I suggest using your college/university logo for the same reason as above
4. Click **Create**

Voila! You just created your first Discord server. 

Keep it up and you’ll be up and running with a class server in no time at all.
