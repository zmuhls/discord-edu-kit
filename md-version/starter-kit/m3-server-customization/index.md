## **Default Channels**

New servers come with two channels: 

1. one text channel: **#general**
2. one voice channel: **General**

New servers also come with one **category** for text channels and one for voice channels. 

Channels are arranged under the umbrella of categories, which serve as the organizing principles of Discord servers. Use them to customize your server as an architect would a building. The intentional arrangement of categories can guide students toward useful resources, help them find information, and encourage participation across channels.

## **Channel Creation**

To create new text and voice channels in your server, follow these steps: 

1. Click the gear icon next to the category where you aim to locate the new channel
2. Choose between a voice or text channel, then name it accordingly
3. Click **Create Channel**, with the privacy option toggled for now. More on that later.

Rinse & repeat until you’ve created a small collection of text and voice channels for your server.
