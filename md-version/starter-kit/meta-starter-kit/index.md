## Welcome Aboard the Starter Kit! 

This section of the toolkit represents the first of three module sequences to support your instructional use of class servers. The Starter Kit will familiarize you with the nuts and bolts of the Discord platform. It begins with an installation guide, then covers server setup, channel customization, role management, managing permissions, and offers guidance for accessibility.

At the end of each module you will find a section linking to external resources. Save these links for a rainy day in case you have a question that these modules donâ€™t answer.

When you complete the Starter Kit, you can chart a course for the [Design Kit](https://discordedu.commons.gc.cuny.edu/design-kit/) followed by the [Instructional Kit](https://discordedu.commons.gc.cuny.edu/instructional-kit/). May the wind be at your back until then! ðŸ’¨â›µ
