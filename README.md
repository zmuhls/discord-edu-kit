# [Discord Educational Toolkit](discordedu.commons.gc.cuny.edu)

## *Instructional Design for Classroom Servers*

#### Project Background:
This repository extends and preserves exported versions of my Discord Educational Toolkit, a pedagogical guide to teaching with Discord servers, which is currently hosted and maintained on the CUNY Academic Commons. Created in fulfillment of the Certificate Program in Interactive Technology and Pedagogy at The Graduate Center, CUNY, the project is archived here for posterity and project sustainability purposes. 

In addition to the XML file exports of the WordPress-native site, I've included a markdown-converted version of the toolkit's webpages. (Thanks to Will Boyd's repo — [wordpress-export-to-markdown](https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown) — for the XML-to-MD conversion script.
