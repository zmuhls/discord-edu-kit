# [Discord Educational Toolkit](discordedu.commons.gc.cuny.edu)

## *Instructional Design for Classroom Servers*

#### Project Background:
This repository extends and preserves exported versions of the Discord Educational Toolkit, a pedagogical guide to teaching with Discord servers that is currently hosted and maintained on the CUNY Academic Commons. Developed in fulfillment of the Certificate Program in Interactive Technology and Pedagogy at The Graduate Center, CUNY, I've chosen to archive the project here for the sake of posterity and project sustainability. 

In addition to the XML file exports of the WordPress-native site, I've enclosed a markdown-converted version of the toolkit's webpages. Thanks to Will Boyd's repo — [wordpress-export-to-markdown](https://github.com/lonekorean/wordpress-export-to-markdown) — for facilitating the xml-to-md conversion process.
